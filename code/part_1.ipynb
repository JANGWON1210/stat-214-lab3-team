    "In this step, we convert raw story transcripts into numerical feature vectors using a Bag-of-Words (BoW) embedding. For each story, we leverage the DataSequence objects provided in raw_text.pkl, which align each word in the transcript with fMRI sampling time intervals (TRs). We use the .chunks() method to segment the words into chunks, where each chunk corresponds to 2 seconds of language input—the same temporal resolution as the fMRI recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then join the words in each chunk into a pseudo-sentence and apply a CountVectorizer to convert these sentences into fixed-dimensional BoW vectors. Each row of the resulting feature matrix represents the word frequency distribution for a specific fMRI timepoint. A shared vocabulary across all stories ensures that the BoW representations are consistent in dimension and semantics.\n",

    "However, these embedding matrices do not yet exactly align in time with the fMRI response matrices (Y), due to potential edge effects and timing discrepancies at the start and end of recordings. This mismatch will be addressed in the next step via temporal trimming and downsampling to ensure proper alignment between stimulus features (X) and brain responses (Y)."

    "To better model the brain’s response to language input, we construct lagged (delayed) features using the make_delayed() function. This function generates new features by concatenating the BoW vectors from previous time steps (TRs). Specifically, for each time point t, we concatenate the features from time steps t-1, t-2, t-3, and t-4, resulting in a temporally extended input vector. This approach allows the model to capture the fact that brain activity at time t may be influenced by language input from several seconds earlier. Using lagged features is standard in encoding models for fMRI, as it helps account for the delayed nature of neural responses."

    "\n",
    "1. Semantic richness\n",
    "Pre-trained embeddings encode semantic similarity between words. Words with similar meanings are located close together in the embedding space, which helps models generalize better. For example, “king” and “queen” will have more similar representations in Word2Vec than in BoW, which treats them as entirely unrelated tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lower dimensionality\n",
    "While BoW vectors are typically high-dimensional and sparse (e.g., 12,000+ dimensions), pre-trained embeddings are dense and compact (e.g., 300 dimensions). This reduces the risk of overfitting and improves computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transfer learning\n",
    "Pre-trained embeddings are learned from massive external corpora (e.g., Wikipedia, Google News), capturing broader linguistic knowledge that may not exist in your training data. This improves performance, especially when your dataset is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Better generalization for rare words\n",
    "In BoW, rare or unseen words are treated as zeros, losing information. Pre-trained embeddings can still provide meaningful vectors for infrequent words (or even out-of-vocabulary handling via averaging subwords or fallback)."
