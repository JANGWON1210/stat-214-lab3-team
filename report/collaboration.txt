Contribution on Project

 1. Xiaotong Zhan - Part 1: Generating Embeddings
    ☐ Generate embedding vectors using Bag-of-Words.
    ☐ Use downsample_word_vectors from code/preprocessing.py to match dimensions.
    ☐ Create lagged versions of the features using make_delayed from code/preprocessing.py with delays in [1, 4].
    ☐ Repeat the above steps using pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings.
    ☐ Repeat the above steps using pre-trained GloVe embeddings.


 2. Xiaoyi Chen - Part 2: Modeling & Evaluation
    ☐ Fit a ridge regression model for each type of embedding.
    ☐ Design a cross-validation scheme to compare models.
       ☐ Analyze model by calculating Mean test CC, Median test CC, Top 1 percentile CC, Top 5 percentile CC
    ☐ For the best-performing embedding (B2W)
       ☐ Analyze the distribution of CC across voxels.
       ☐ Plot the CC distribution.
       ☐ Describe any patterns or insights from the distribution.
    ☐ Evaluate whether the model performs well across all voxels.
    ☐ Perform a stability analysis.

  3. Jangwon Lee
    ☐ Before Xiaoyi took over Part 2, it was initially assigned to Jangwon Lee, who made efforts to obtain results but was unsuccessful, which led to Xiaoyi taking over the task.
    ☐ Refine the part_2.ipynb notebook for readability by adding docstrings and comments.
    ☐ Performed tasks such as writing run.sh, environment.yaml, and other necessary components to meet the output requirements.
